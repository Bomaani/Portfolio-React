        <h3>Wanna know a little bit more about me?</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently a front end developer and graduate from the Savannah
          College of Art and Design. I've gotten many opportunities to work on
          amazing projects such as the HBO Game of Thrones viewers guide in
          season one! A project that won our team a Primetime Emmy Award for
          Interactive Web Design! I love programming and the challenges it
          brings. I'm a very critical thinker and tackle all of my problems head
          on and without hesitation. When I am not programming, learning, or
          trying to keep up with how fast the world of technology changes and
          evolves, you can find me playing video games, listening to music and
          going to shows, offroading in my old wrangler, or playing with the
          dogs amongst other outdoor activities. I also love to garden and keep
          my ever growing collection of plants happy and healthy, even the sassy
          ones that dont like to be moved, watered, or touched often.
