        <p>
          I am currently a Front End Developer and graduate from the Savannah
          College of Art and Design and Thinkful. I've gotten many opportunities to work on
          amazing projects such as the HBO Game of Thrones viewers guide in
          season one! A project that won our team a Primetime Emmy Award for
          Interactive Web Design! I love programming and the challenges it
          brings. I'm a very critical thinker and tackle all of my problems head
          on and without hesitation.
